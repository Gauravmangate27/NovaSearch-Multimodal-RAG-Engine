Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms 
and statistical models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

Core Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction and feedback

Common Algorithms:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks
- K-Means Clustering

Tools and Libraries:
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

Deep Learning with Neural Networks

Deep Learning is a branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers 
to process and learn from complex data patterns. These networks are inspired by biological neural systems.

Architecture Types:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): For image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): For sequence data
- Transformers: For natural language processing
- Autoencoders: For unsupervised learning

Key Advantages:
- Automatic feature extraction
- Can learn hierarchical representations
- Highly effective for unstructured data
- Scales well with large datasets

Applications:
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Time Series Forecasting
